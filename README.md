# Dice thing
A trivial dice program for DnD which I wrote after forgetting to get some physical dice this one time.

## Requirements

- Python 3 installation
- Docopt command line library (`pip install docopt`)
- Art python library (`pip install art`)

## Installation

Just clone the repository and put the root directory of the project on your
PATH. Run `dice --help` for usage information.

That's all!
